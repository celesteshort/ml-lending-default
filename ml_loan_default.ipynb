    "Lending Club is a peer-to-peer lending company with its headquarters in San Francisco, California.  It began by operating as an online consumer-lending platform that enables borrowers to obtain an unsecured loan that's funded by investors.  Investors are able to search and browse the loan listings on Lending Club website and select loans that they want to invest in based on the information supplied about the borrower, amount of loan, loan grade, and loan purpose. Investors make money from the interest on these loans. The loans can only be chosen at the interest rates assigned by Lending Club, but investors could decide how much to fund each borrower, with a minimum investment of $25.  Investors make money from the interest.  Lending Club makes money by charging borrowers an origination fee and investors a service fee.\n",
